<!-- 
Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites, but thereâ€™s no backend to send your data to.

However, you can use free SaaS as a backend for forms, such as [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to handle form submissions. Sleek has a configured form using formspree ready for you. All you have to do is change the email in `.config.yml`.

Check the form below to see it in action! -->
<!-- 
### Example Formspree contact

Fill in the form or [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to discuss your next project.

{% include form.html %}

{% include modal.html %} -->

If you are interested in any position within our group (Postdoc, PhD, MS, Visitor, Intern, etc.), please fill out the interest survey below instead of sending an email. This will help us organize our responses more efficiently. Individual emails may not receive a response.

We are actively seeking highly motivated individuals to support ongoing projects focused on algorithmic biases, shortcut learning, and benchmark datasets for machine learning.
